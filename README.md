### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the data could be transform to visualization. Recognize patern of data and seek the goal of the data mining, we will make visualization
data into many form for describe the data understanding. 

### Process of Visualization
1. Filtering dan Processing
   Filtering and cleaning data to convert it into useful information through processes of analysis, interpretation, contextualization, comparison, and research.

2. Translation and Visual Representation
   Forms a visual representation by defining the graphic source, language, context, and colors of the representation all tailored to the recipient.

3. Perception and Interpretation
   Visualisasi menjadi efektif ketika dapat memberikan pengaruh terhadap konstruksi pengetahuan.

### Data Visualization Form
Several graphs can be used to transform the data we have into information.

1. Bar Charts

Bar charts are very versatile and are commonly used to compare discrete categories to analyze changes over time, or compare multiple pieces of data.

   
2. Histograms

Histograms present variables in the form of bars, where the surface of each bar corresponds to the frequency of the value represented.

3. Pie Charts

Pie charts are in the form of a circle divided into several sectors/lines with each circle representing a part of the whole.

4. Scatter Plots

Scatter plots use a distribution of points on a Cartesian coordinate plane to show the relationship between two variables.

5. Heat Maps

Heat maps represent individual values ​​from a data set in a matrix using color variations or color intensity.

6. Line Charts

Line charts are used to show changes or changing trends in data over a period of time.

7. Bubble Charts

These graphs display three-dimensional data and highlight data on distribution maps and diagrams.

8. Radar Charts

Radar charts are a form of representation built around regular polygons contained in a circle, where the radius guiding the points is the axis along which the values ​​are represented.

9. Waterfall Charts

This graph helps in understanding the cumulative effect of positive and negative values ​​on variables in sequential form.

10. Tree Maps

Tree maps display multilevel (hierarchical) data in the form of a tree structure.&nbsp;

11. Charts Area

Area charts represent the relationship of a series over time, but unlike line charts, these charts can present volume.
